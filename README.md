Howdy!

My name is Harris, this github is for my personal projects and other things. This mainly exists to give others a better understanding of my coding abilities. 

---------
start here:
https://github.com/LordHarns/Boolean-Algebra-Simplifier


------
The other projects are older and don't represent my current abilities, but feel free to view them.

LordHarns/LordHarns is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
